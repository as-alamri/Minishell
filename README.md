# Minishell

In this project we are asked to mimic the behaviour of a bash shell.

We don't need to create a new window/ tabs our vertical splits like our iTerm. 

Our assignment consists in creating a ./minishell executable that when opened, will show a prompt (>msh) and wait for user input. 

The user can then type any shell commands like echo, ls, env export, pwd and we will show the exact same information / error messages as bash.
